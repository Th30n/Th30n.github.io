Hello everyone,

I'm Teon Banek and I'm from Zagreb, Croatia.

My first encounter with programming was when I was 12 years old. I set out to
make a 3D game with DarkBASIC. Obviously, I bit off more than I could chew and
never finished it. This focused my love of computers toward software
development and in 2015 I got my MSc in Computing.

I started this blog to learn and improve my knowledge  of computer graphics
and various aspects of software development. Hopefully along the way this will
also help other people. I welcome feedback via email, comments or leaving them
as a [github issue](https://github.com/Th30n/Th30n.github.io/issues).
